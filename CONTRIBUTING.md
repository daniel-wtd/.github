## Welcome

First off, thanks for taking time to contribute. We really appreciate every
contribution in form of Reports, Requests, Discussions or every other bit,
that will help to grow the project.

Please read the below text carefully before contributing.

## Bug Reports

Reporting Bugs should follow some simple rules:

- **Check**, if you can find similar Bugs
- **Describe** what is happening and what should happen
- **Explain** why this is a problem
- **Add** more details and attachments
- **Follow up**, if somebody is having questions or needs more details

## Feature Requests

Requesting a new feature is also following some simple rules:

- **Check**, if the feature is already requested
- **Describe** what your feature will bring to the community
- **Explain** the criteria to fulfill the request
- **Add** more details like mock ups, attachments, lists, screenshots
- **Follow Up** in the discussion to the feature

## Code Contribution

Contributing Code should be as easy as possible. Therefore, all needed
information should be present in the README.md of each repository. Some basic
rules should be applied.

- **File an issue** for each code contribution (see above)
- **One Contribution** should solve **one issue**
- **Tested** code is **cool** code
- **Documented** code is **maintainable** code
- **Commit Messages** should be useful and self explaining
